# Qodo ships as a single bundled qodo.mjs, resolved through
# https://get.qodo.ai/version.json (keyed by "channel", pre-GA only has
# "next") rather than a fixed release URL -- so this pins the specific
# {version, url, sha256} that endpoint returned for the `next` channel
# rather than running the vendor install.sh, which re-resolves the latest
# release from that endpoint on every run (impure, and would drift out from
# under the Nix store). Bump version/hash here to update.
#
# The upstream installer also wires its own auto-updater (see
# QODO_DISABLE_AUTOUPDATE below); that's disabled here since this
# derivation -- not `qodo` itself -- owns the installed version.
